# 🔐 Streamlit Cloud Secrets Setup Guide

## IMPORTANT: Your Azure credentials have been secured!

Your app is already configured to use Streamlit secrets properly. Follow these steps to set up your Azure credentials securely in Streamlit Cloud:

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Go to Streamlit Cloud Settings
1. Open your browser and go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Find your app: **voigtsbusai**
3. Click the **⚙️ Settings** button (three dots menu → Settings)

### 2. Navigate to Secrets
1. In the app settings, click on **"Secrets"** in the left sidebar
2. You'll see a text editor for your app's secrets

### 3. Add Your Azure Credentials
Copy and paste this configuration into the Streamlit Cloud secrets editor:

```toml
[azure]
endpoint = "YOUR_AZURE_ENDPOINT_HERE"
api_key = "YOUR_AZURE_API_KEY_HERE"

[app]
title = "Voigts Student Opt-In Data Management Suite"
description = "Professional transportation data processing for school districts"
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Replace the placeholder values above with your actual Azure credentials:
- `YOUR_AZURE_ENDPOINT_HERE` → Your actual Azure endpoint URL
- `YOUR_AZURE_API_KEY_HERE` → Your actual Azure API key

### 4. Save and Deploy
1. Click **"Save"** in the Streamlit Cloud secrets editor
2. Your app will automatically redeploy with the secure credentials
3. The Azure AI functionality will work perfectly!

## 🛡️ Security Benefits

✅ **Credentials are NOT in your GitHub repository**
✅ **Only accessible to your Streamlit Cloud app**
✅ **Encrypted and secure in Streamlit's infrastructure**
✅ **Can be updated without changing code**
✅ **No risk of accidental exposure**

## 🔧 How It Works

Your code uses `st.secrets["azure"]["endpoint"]` and `st.secrets["azure"]["api_key"]` which:
- Reads from Streamlit Cloud's secure secrets management
- Falls back gracefully if secrets aren't available
- Keeps your credentials completely separate from your code

## 📝 Important Notes

- **Never commit secrets.toml to GitHub** (already handled with .gitignore)
- **Secrets are environment-specific** (development vs production)
- **Only you can access/modify these secrets** in your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
- **Secrets are encrypted at rest** and in transit

## ✅ Verification

After setting up secrets in Streamlit Cloud:
1. Visit your app: https://voigtsbusai.streamlit.app
2. Try the "AI Data Extraction" feature
3. Upload a PDF and verify Azure AI is working
4. Check that no credentials appear in browser developer tools

Your app is now production-ready and secure! 🎉
